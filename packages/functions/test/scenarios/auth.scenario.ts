/**
 * Replaces e2e/tests/features/auth.feature.
 *
 * The gherkin drove the login form: "a test account exists" → "the user signs
 * in through the login form" → "they land on the app". Scenario actors are
 * signed in by the runner before the first step, so there is no form to drive
 * and no signed-out state to start from. What that gherkin actually proved —
 * a real session, carried in a real cookie, admitted to the gated area — is
 * proved here by opening `/app` and not being bounced to `/app/login`.
 *
 * This is the same claim over a shorter path, and it now covers the actor
 * sign-in endpoint too, which is what every other browser scenario depends on.
 * The login FORM itself is no longer covered; if that matters to your app, test
 * it as an API scenario against `/api/auth/sign-in/email`, which is where a
 * wrong password is actually refused.
