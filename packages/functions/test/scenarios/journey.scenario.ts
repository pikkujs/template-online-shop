/**
 * The job this app exists for, performed through the browser.
 *
 * The shop's own home page states the journey: "Browse the catalogue, fill a
 * basket, and check out." This scenario is that sentence, clicked.
 *
 * It is expected to FAIL today, and the failure is the finding. `addToBasket`,
 * `getBasket`, `removeFromBasket`, `createOrder`, `listOrders` and
 * `checkout.workflow.ts` are all wired and exercised by `shopperBuysAnItem` —
 * which completes a purchase over RPC without ever asking whether a person
 * could. There is no basket route, no basket count in the shell, and no
 * checkout screen, so the shopper can put things in and never see them again.
 *
 * Do not weaken this scenario to make it pass. It should stay red until the
 * basket and order screens exist, then pass without being touched.
