 * Who may do it.
 *
 * These are *system* roles: they ship with the shop, and the console may grant
 * them but cannot rename, re-scope or delete them. Roles an operator composes
 * in the console are a different thing and are not declared here — which is
 * also why a persona may only name a system role. A composed role can be
 * deleted, and a persona pinned to one would go on claiming to test something
 * nobody grants any more.
 *
 * Removing a role from this file does not revoke it. The row stays, marked
 * undeclared and inert, until `pikku roles prune` — a deploy should not be able
 * to strip access from live customers the moment it rolls out.
