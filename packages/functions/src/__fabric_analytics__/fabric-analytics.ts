/**
 * Fabric-injected product-analytics forwarder. The deploy container drops this
 * file into the user's `packages/functions/src/__fabric_analytics__/` before
 * `pikku bootstrap` runs, overwriting the copy that ships in the template. The
 * template's copy exists only so the app typechecks and runs locally; fabric
 * owns the deployed one so the transport can change without touching anyone's
 * repo.
 *
 * Unlike `__fabric_telemetry__` this is NOT middleware — there is no invocation
 * to wrap. The template's `/analytics` ingest function calls it with the events
 * it accepted and the identity it resolved from the session.
 *
 * Transport mirrors the telemetry middleware exactly:
 *
 *   - CF Worker  → `console.log(JSON.stringify(record))` → tail worker → OO
 *   - container  → `queueService.add('fabric-telemetry', …)` → backend → OO
 *
 * If FABRIC_STREAM_CLASS is unset (local dev, or an un-injected build) this
 * no-ops, so nothing has to branch on the environment at the call site.
