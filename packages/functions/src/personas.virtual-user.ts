/**
 * The people this app is for, and the people its scenarios run as.
 *
 * One `definePersonas` call for the whole project — codegen builds the
 * `PersonaId` union from it, materialises one scenario actor per person, and
 * seeds a user row each, so a second call site would be a second answer to
 * "who uses this app". Add yours here.
 *
 * Addresses are never written down: each is derived from the persona id and
 * `scenarios.emailDomain` in pikku.config.json, so `visitor` signs in as
 * visitor@actors.local. Writing one by hand is how a run signs in as somebody
 * who was never created.
