/**
 * What may be done in the shop.
 *
 * Every node is grantable, so nesting is where the boundary goes: granting
 * `catalogue` grants `catalogue:read` and `catalogue:write` with it. That is
 * why `read` and `write` are siblings under `catalogue` rather than two
 * top-level scopes — a role that should manage the catalogue outright says
 * `catalogue`, and one that should only browse says `catalogue:read`.
 *
 * The declaration is a no-op the CLI reads by AST. It generates a `ScopeId`
 * union, so a function gating on a scope nobody declared is a compile error
 * rather than a gate that silently never matches.

/**
 * There is deliberately no `admin` here.
 *
 * `@pikku/addon-console` already declares `admin` — with `impersonate`,
 * `credentials` and a `users` subtree — and scopes sharing a name must declare
 * the same tree, so a second declaration is a build error rather than a silent
 * merge. Managing customer accounts is `admin:users`, which the console already
 * defines; the shop only declares what is genuinely its own.
 *
 * This is the normal case, not a special one: an app composes its scopes with
 * whatever its addons bring.
