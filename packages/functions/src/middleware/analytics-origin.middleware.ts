/**
 * Server-side origin lock for the unauthed `/analytics` ingest.

 * This is NOT what `cors()` does. `cors()` sets response headers and is enforced
 * by the browser — a non-browser client ignores them entirely and the request
 * still runs. This rejects, with a 403, before the function body.
 *
 * What it buys is precise: it stops another site's page from beaconing into this
 * app's endpoint, which is the cheap and likely abuse. `Origin` is set by the
 * browser and trusted by nobody else, so a determined flood is not addressed
 * here at all — that is a rate limit's job, and there isn't one yet.
 *
 * A **missing** `Origin` is rejected too: a real browser beacon always sets one
 * on a cross-origin-capable POST, so its absence means a non-browser caller.
 *
 * Left at the default priority so it runs *inside* the global CORS middleware,
 * which means the 403 still carries CORS headers rather than surfacing in the
 * browser as an opaque network error.
