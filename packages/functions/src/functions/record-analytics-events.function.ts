/**
 * Product-analytics ingest. Unauthenticated by necessity — anonymous visitors
 * are most of what this measures — so the wiring carries an origin lock that
 * rejects anything that is not a browser on this app's own origin. There is no
 * rate limit on it yet; see the wiring.
 *
 * **Identity is stamped here, from the session, and never read from the body.**
 * A signed-in request records the user; anything else records nothing at all —
 * no device storage, no visitor id, no consent banner. That is the whole
 * identity model, and it is why an unauthed endpoint is safe to expose: there
 * is no field a caller could set to attribute events to someone else.
