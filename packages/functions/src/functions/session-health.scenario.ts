/**
 * A scenario is a story of RPC calls told through a synthetic persona (an
 * "actor" — one exists per persona declared with definePersonas). Every step runs over
 * the REAL transport with the actor's session cookie, so a passing scenario
 * proves the deployed API works exactly as a signed-in user would experience it.
 *
 * Run it with `pikku scenario run local` (needs SCENARIO_ACTOR_SECRET in the
 * environment — the actor plugin in src/auth.ts refuses sign-ins without it).
 * It signs ANY defined actor in and reads their own session: actor sign-in,
 * session cookie, authed RPC, and session mapping in one pass — a ready-made
 * health check for staging or production.
 *
 * It is deliberately actor-AGNOSTIC: it uses the starter's `visitor` if present,
 * else the first actor the app defines. So when you replace the seeded `visitor`
 * with your own role actors (admin/operator/…), this keeps working untouched —
 * never edit it just to name a different actor.
