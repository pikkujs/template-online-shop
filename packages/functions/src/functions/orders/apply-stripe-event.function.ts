 * Turn a verified Stripe event into a change to this shop's orders.
 *
 * The addon's receiver has already checked the signature and answered Stripe;
 * this runs off the queue, where a slow database or a bad deploy costs a retry
 * rather than making Stripe believe the endpoint is down and start backing off.
 *
 * The order id travels in the payment intent's metadata, which is where the
 * checkout step puts it. Stripe knows nothing about our order ids otherwise.
