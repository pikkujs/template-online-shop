/**
 * The webchat gateway's handler.
 *
 * It exists because the websocket gateway was wired to `handlePaymentWebhook` —
 * the handler that marks orders paid or failed from the body of the message it
 * is given. Nothing reached it, because the demo adapter's `init` is a stub that
 * never registers a callback, so the mis-wiring was inert rather than
 * exploitable. It would not have stayed inert: the moment somebody filled that
 * adapter in to make chat work, an unauthenticated socket would have been able
 * to mark any order paid by naming its id.
 *
 * Two gateways of different types sharing one handler is the smell. A gateway
 * handler is written against the messages of exactly one source.

// @coverage-unreachable a websocket gateway's message handler is never invoked in a generated app: `wireGateway` registers the channel with an inline empty `onMessage` and puts the real handler in channel meta, but codegen does not emit the gateway channel, so route resolution finds nothing and runs the stub. Framework gap, not a template one.
