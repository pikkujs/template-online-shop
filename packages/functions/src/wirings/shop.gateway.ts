/**
 * Gateways are for conversational transports — Slack, WhatsApp, a web chat
 * widget. The adapter's job is to turn one platform's messages into the shape
 * every handler sees, and to send a reply back the way it came.
 *
 * That is the whole test of whether something belongs here: is there a sender,
 * and can you answer them? The payment webhook used to be wired as a gateway and
 * failed both — it now lives in `functions/orders/handle-payment-webhook` behind
 * an ordinary HTTP route, which is what a webhook is.
