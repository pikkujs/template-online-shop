 * A scheduled task, not a trigger source spinning its own `setInterval`.
 *
 * Noticing that stock has run low is the clock passing rather than an event
 * anybody emits, so something has to look. The original looked by starting a
 * timer inside a trigger source, which reimplemented `wireScheduler` badly: it
 * could not be invoked once, so nothing could test it, an operator had no way
 * to force a pass, and any call would have leaked an interval.
