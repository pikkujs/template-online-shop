/**
 * The `data-analytics-click` listener — sugar over `recordEvent()` for the
 * click-shaped majority and for instrumenting a component whose callbacks you
 * do not own:
 *
 *   <Button data-analytics-click="pricing_cta" data-analytics-meta='{"tier":"pro"}' />
 *
 * Named by **trigger**, so `data-analytics-submit` / `data-analytics-change` can
 * be added later as their own listeners rather than overloading this one.
 *
 * One delegated listener rather than wrapped component callbacks, because
 * **portalled content** — Mantine modals, menus, select dropdowns — renders
 * outside its logical DOM position but still under `document`, so it is covered
 * for free. The trade-off is that ancestor meta merging does not reach it: a
 * portalled element's DOM ancestry is the portal container, not the card it
 * visually sits in. Events fired from portalled surfaces need self-sufficient
 * names.
