/**
 * Buffered product-analytics client.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** a `useMutation`. That hook exists for async work with
 * user-visible state — `isPending` drives a spinner, `error` renders. Analytics
 * has neither, must never surface a failure to the user, and must not retry
 * aggressively. So: a buffer, flushed on an interval, on size, and on the page
 * going away.
 *
 * The unload flush is the one that matters. The last events before someone
 * leaves are the abandon point — the most valuable rows in any funnel — and a
 * plain `fetch()` fired during unload is cancelled. `sendBeacon` is queued by
 * the browser and survives the page.
